# pcbdemo
Demonstrates my way to structure Kicad projects, see detailed description in 

pcbdemo/doc/pcbdemo.pdf
.
Includes a few makefiles and scripts to help maintain the documentation
of the designed PCBs.

This project produces pdf and html files based on the kicad_pcb
file in addition to bom and component position files.

Uses Python, Asciidoc, Prince and asciidoctor.

Prince (https://www.princexml.com/) converts html/css files to pdf and
lets you produce pdfs formatted by the css. In this case I used the
default formatting.

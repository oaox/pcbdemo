# pcbdemo
Demonstrates my way to structure Kicad projects, [see this detailed description](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JHl--ZBm-yBnHo4EsdYiNkQbSJKahwBfRaquYGXdDP8/edit?usp=sharing) . Includes a few makefiles and scripts to help maintain the documentation of the designed PCBs.

This project produces pdf and html files based on the kicad_pcb file in addition to bom and component position files.

Uses Python, Asciidoc, pdftk, ImageMagick, a2x and asciidoctor.

# pcbdemo
Demonstrates my way to structure Kicad projects, [see this detailed description](https://github.com/oaox/pcbdemo/blob/76fcd5422103fdb88cf196ecd714038d3a444ae3/pcbdemo/doc/html/pcbdemo.html) . Includes a few makefiles and scripts to help maintain the documentation of the designed PCBs.

This project produces pdf and html files based on the kicad_pcb file in addition to bom and component position files.

Uses Python, Asciidoc, pdftk, ImageMagick, a2x and asciidoctor.
